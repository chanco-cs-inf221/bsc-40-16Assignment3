                 <p><img src="images/Sean-Kingston-Peace-Of-Mind.jpg" class="align-right">The idea of generics represents the abstraction over types (well-known to C++ developers as templates). It is a very powerful
                        concept (which came up quite a while ago) that allows to develop abstract algorithms and data structures and to provide concrete
                        types to operate on later. Interestingly, generics were not present in the early versions of Java and were added along the way only
                        in Java 5 release. And since then, it is fair to say that generics revolutionized the way Java programs are being written, delivering
                        much stronger type guaranties and making code significantly safer.
                        In this section we are going to cover the usage of generics everywhere, starting from interfaces, classes and methods. Providing
                        a lot of benefits, generics however do introduce some limitations and side-effects which we also are going to cover.</p>

                       <p><img src="images/Sean-Kingston-Peace-Of-Mind.jpg" class="align-right"> Normally it is sufficient to switch on the power to boot a Unix-like host. Sometimes
                            you might have to type ‘boot’ or ‘b’ to get it going. Unix systems can boot in several
                            different modes or run levels. The most common modes are called multi-user
                            mode and single-user mode. On different kinds of Unix, these might translate
                            into run-levels with different numbers, but there is no consensus. In single-user
                            mode no external logins are permitted. The purpose of single-user mode is to allow
                            the system administrator access to the system without fear of interference from
                            other users. It is used for installing disks or when repairing filesystems, where the
                            presence of other users on the system would cause problems.
